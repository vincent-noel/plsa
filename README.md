# plsa
C library for non-linear optimization, using a parallelized Lam-Delosme simulated annealing.

To compile the shared library, use make all

To compile and install it in your /usr/lib and /usr/include, use sudo make install


This library is based on the following publication : 

Chu, King-Wai, Yuefan Deng, and John Reinitz. "Parallel simulated annealing by mixing of states." Journal of Computational Physics 148.2 (1999): 646-662.


Thanks to John Reinitz for sending me the code.
